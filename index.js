        **Agro Ratna**

Agro Ratna is an innovative project aimed at modernizing agricultural practices through automation and smart technologies. It includes several key farming features such as **Ploughing**, **Seed Sowing Mechanism**, **Soil Moisture Monitoring**, **Grass Cutter**, **Stone Remover**, **Animal Recognition**, and **NPK Sensor for Soil Analysis**.

---

__**Features and Demonstrations**__

🌾 **Ploughing**  
Our Ploughing Mechanism ploughs the field efficiently when commanded.  
- **How it works**: It consists of a Servo Motor connected to an Arduino Uno for precise control.  

🌱 **Seed Sowing Mechanism**  
Automatically sows seeds in the field as needed.  
- **How it works**: Powered by a Servo Motor and a creative Bottle System designed by the team.  

💧 **Soil Moisture Monitoring**  
Ensures water is provided to the field only when necessary.  
- **How it works**: Utilizes a Soil Moisture Sensor, Arduino Nano, and a Breadboard for water flow control.  

✂️ **Grass Cutter**  
Cuts the grass in the field when required.  
- **How it works**: Controlled by a DC Motor and Arduino Nano for smooth operation.  

🪨 **Stone Remover**  
Removes stones from the land to prepare it for farming activities.  
- **How it works**: Operated by a DC Motor for efficient stone removal.

🐾 **Animal Recognition**  
Detects the presence of animals in the field to prevent damage to crops.  
- **How it works**: Uses a camera module with machine learning algorithms to recognize animals and alert the farmer via a connected system.  

🧪 **NPK Sensor for Soil Analysis**  
Measures the levels of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in the soil to determine its fertility.  
- **How it works**: Incorporates an NPK Sensor with Arduino to provide real-time nutrient data for better decision-making.
